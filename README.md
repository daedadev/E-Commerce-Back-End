# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This application utilizes Sequelize and MySQL to create a backend using Sequelize models and relationships allowing for easy item management and tracking. The model system allows for easy updates through PUT routes, simple creation through POST routes, and painless removal through DELETE routes. Couple this with Express.js and you have ways of fetching, updating and removing with ease.

Thank you for viewing my project and I hope you enjoy.

## Usage

Linked here is a video displaying the various POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE routes.
